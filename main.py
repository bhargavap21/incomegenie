st.write("Our app is a tool for small businesses and investors to analyze the income statements of a business. The user can upload a .csv file containing the income statement data, and the app will display the data in a table format. The user can then select a specific row from the table to analyze. The app will then display a line chart showing the income data for the selected row, and it will also perform a polynomial linear regression on the data to generate a trendline. Additionally, the app will make predictions for the next three years based on the trendline, and these predictions are plotted on the chart as points.  Overall, our app provides a way to visually explore and make predictions about a company's financial performance.")
